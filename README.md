# Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

In this project, the focus is on analyzing customer responses to driving coupons delivered through a mobile application. The dataset, sourced from a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, encompasses various driving scenarios, each associated with specific attributes such as gender, age, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, annual income, and driving habits related to different types of coupons (e.g., restaurants, coffee houses, bars).

The overarching goal is to understand the factors influencing a driver's decision to accept or reject a coupon. Scenarios include considerations of proximity to the business, time, weather, presence of passengers, and the specific type of coupon. For instance, questions may arise around whether drivers are more likely to accept a coupon for a restaurant, coffee house, or bar. Moreover, factors such as the age and gender of the driver, the presence of children, and the urgency of the destination are considered.

The analysis involves employing visualizations, statistical summaries, and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted driving coupons and those who did not. Potential questions to address include:

Demographic Influence: Does the age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, or annual income of a driver impact their likelihood of accepting a coupon?

Driving Habits: Are there patterns in the number of times a driver goes to a restaurant, coffee house, bar, or engages in takeaway food purchases that correlate with coupon acceptance?

Location and Urgency: How does the location of the user, destination, and venue influence coupon acceptance? Does the urgency of the destination play a role?

Weather and Time: Are drivers more inclined to accept coupons during certain weather conditions or times of the day?

Passenger Presence: Does the presence of passengers, such as a partner, children, or friends, affect coupon acceptance?
